## Part 02, Section 5 of the Udemy course

Continuation of my practice programs for the Udemy course I am taking.

<br>

### This part contains:
A simple program that seperates each bit of lecture into its own part, so I wont have to modify the code every time I would like to take a look at it working again. <br><br>This program includes the following lectures:
  * Pointer, Value manipulation for Pointer by changing memory address, Memory address used as function parameter
  * Arithmetics or more like: Sec to HrMinSec converter. I wont use assignment operators other than "=" from now on. They go against clean code for me. No good.
  * Ptr & Array: Currently being developed, tomorrow it will get FINISHED.
  * Char Array: Looping through one, 3 variants.
  * Extras: LinkedList, Double Linked List implementations. (Soon)
     * **To be continued.**
<br>

## Note to self: Dont forget that /MP and /permissive, /permissive- are Project Properties, having to be set up again the way I prefer every time I make a new project. Maybe find a workaround that? Should make a collection of my prefered project settings / formatting soon grouped into one place so its all fanceyyyy~
### During this segment of my journey I've also learned about:
 * /MP, Multi-processor compilation - In a nutshell reducing compilation times since VStudio is using a single core to compile. Turning this off decreases compile time, increases fun having to be had.
 * /permissive, /permissive-, Conformance mode, turning it off / on, why it is beneficial to have it off / on.
 * Project Templates (NEEDS RESEARCH!)
 * SFML, using it in action
 * Windows-Debian cross-platform working with git (lionkor/slappy-test) 
   ### Reference to materials listed above (in order):
    * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/permissive-standards-conformance?view=msvc-160
    * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/mp-build-with-multiple-processes?view=msvc-160
 
### Learn programming:
If you are interested in learning C++, I can wholeheartedly recommend tagging along with this course:<br>

I've had alot of troubles with understanding the basics, and having a good,
easy to understand reference / tutorial that I can always go back to.

This course to me felt like the missing piece I needed,
so I am very grateful I have a friend who recommended it to me. (<3)
