## Part 02, Section 5 of the Udemy course

Continuation of my practice programs for the Udemy course I am taking.

### Note: Things will probaly get commented out as I progress, because I am working in a single solution for a bunch of tutorials.

<br>

This part contains:
  * Pointer, Value manipulation for Pointer by changing memory address, Memory address used as function parameter

### Note: myFunction(&newValue);
          myFunction(p_value);
      
Whats the difference? Yes, I know I cleared it up once, but Im curious if I will remember why they are different, tomorrow!

<br>

### Learn programming:
If you are interested in learning C++, I can wholeheartedly recommend tagging along with this course:<br>

I've had alot of troubles with understanding the basics, and having a good,
easy to understand reference / tutorial that I can always go back to.

This course to me felt like the missing piece I needed,
so I am very grateful I have a friend who recommended it to me. (<3)
