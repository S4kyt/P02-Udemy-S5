## Part 02, Section 5 of the Udemy course

Continuation of my practice programs for the Udemy course I am taking.

<br>

### This part contains:
A simple program that seperates each bit of lecture into its own part, so I wont have to modify the code every time I would like to take a look at it working again. <br><br>This program includes the following lectures:
  * Pointer, Value manipulation for Pointer by changing memory address, Memory address used as function parameter
  * Arithmetics, Sec to HrMinSec converter. I wont use assignment operators other than "=" from now on. They go against clean code for me. No good.
     * **To be continued.**
     
<br>

### Learn programming:
If you are interested in learning C++, I can wholeheartedly recommend tagging along with this course:<br>

I've had alot of troubles with understanding the basics, and having a good,
easy to understand reference / tutorial that I can always go back to.

This course to me felt like the missing piece I needed,
so I am very grateful I have a friend who recommended it to me. (<3)
