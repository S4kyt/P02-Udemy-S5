// Yes, Im aware I named this header file main.h, is that considered bad practice in my case?
// I am wondering because I am using this header file currently to reference functions that I am going to call,
// In the main function, every other file that will be used for this solution will be relating to other subjects
// And not to main. Thats why I think it isn't as bad, I quite like it regardless.
